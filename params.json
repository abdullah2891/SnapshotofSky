The wireless was configured to talk with arduino using UART protocol.I used XBee library in arduino to interface with the wireless adapter.\r\nthe arduino was also controlling the servo and taking analog input from photocell.After every turn of secondary servos turn, xbee was sending a packet to host with the position of primary arm. \r\n\r\n#Xbee Adapter , Python and Matlab parser: \r\nXbee serial adpater was used to interface between XBee cordinator and a Windows machine. Python serial library was used to handle the serial streaming of XBee(matlab proved to be slow). \r\nMy partners had codes in matlab; the data was transferred to matlab and parsed into a image.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Example Snapshot\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/abdullah2891/SnapshotofSky/blob/master/example_snapshot.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
